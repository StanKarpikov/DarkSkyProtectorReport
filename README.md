# DarkSkyProtector Outdoor Lighting System: Astronomical Test Report

## Abstract

29 June 2019 test observations were performed at the 60-cm telescope of the Caucasus mountain observatory of the Sternberg astronomical institute (Lomonosov Moscow state university) with the “DarkSkyProtector Outdoor Lighting System” developed for an artificial light pollution suppression in astronomical observations. Test “street” light sources were installed nearby the telescope which modulated (f = 150 Hz) illumination boosted the local sky background from V = 21m up to V = 19.6m per square arcsecond. Using a synchronous disk shutter with the light loss ratio of 40%, the direct CCD stellar images of several sky areas were obtained. The measurement of sky background in these areas demonstrated a nearly complete cutoff of the additional light pollution (leaking factor 6%). The intrinsic quality of differential aperture stellar photometry remains good (σ = 0.003 m); the width of stellar image profiles has minorly increased (by ≈ 0.3′′ ). Recomendations are given to
overcome a number of uncovered technological issues (system control improvement, lowering electromagnetic interference, vibrations and light losses). Thus upgraded, the technology may be incorporated in background-limited astronomical observations to gain in signal to noise ratio at the sites where the respective modernisation of the nearby infrastructure objects is possible
